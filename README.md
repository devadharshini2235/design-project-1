Define Recipe Data:

    Create an array recipesData containing recipe objects.
    Each recipe object includes details like title, ingredients, image, id, and its variants.

Define Search Function (searchRecipes):

    Input: A string of ingredients provided by the user.
    Split the input string by commas into an array (ingredientsList) and convert each item to lowercase, trimming whitespace.
    Iterate over the recipesData array and check if any ingredient in the recipe matches an ingredient in the ingredientsList:
        Use some method to compare each recipe ingredient against ingredientsList.
    Return a filtered list of recipes (filteredRecipes) that match the criteria.

Handle Form Submission:

    Attach an event listener to the form with the ID 'ingredients-form'.
    When the form is submitted:
        Prevent the default form submission behavior.
        Retrieve the user-provided ingredients from the input field with ID 'ingredients'.
        Call the searchRecipes function with the user-provided ingredients.
    If no recipes are found:
        Display an alert message: "No recipes found. Try other ingredients!".
    If recipes are found:
        Store the filtered recipes in localStorage as a JSON string.
        Redirect the user to recipes.html (ensure the file exists and is correctly linked).

Rendering in Recipes Page (recipes.html) (Implied):

    On the recipes.html page, retrieve the filteredRecipes data from localStorage and display the recipes.
